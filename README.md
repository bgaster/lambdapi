LambdaPi
========

This repo provides a simple implementation of a dependently 
typed lambda calculus. It is implemented in Scala and based 
on the Haskell described implementation of dependent types
in the paper:

    A Tutorial Implementation of a Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus
    Andres LÃ¶h, Conor McBride and Wouter Swierstra
    http://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/LambdaPi.pdf
 
It really offers nothing more, currently at least, than the original paper,
rather I wanted to better understand how to implement a system with 
dependent types, as I've been using them a lot recently (well one in particular,
Agda). There is nothing like implementing an idea to help you better understand it!
And along the way I was forced to develop a better understanding of Scala too.
